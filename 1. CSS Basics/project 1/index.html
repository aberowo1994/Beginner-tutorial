              <img src="/images/img1.jpg" alt="" /> Coronaviruses are a group of
              related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In
              humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can
              range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some
              cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses,
              predominantly rhinoviruses),
              <img src="/images/img2.jpg" alt="" /> while more lethal varieties
              can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19, which is causing an ongoing
              pandemic. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they
              cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis. Coronaviruses constitute
              the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae,
              order Nidovirales and realm Riboviria.
              <img src="/images/img3.jpg" alt="" /> They are enveloped viruses
              with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a
              nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.[5] The genome size of
              coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of
              the largest among RNA viruses.
              <img src="/images/img4.jpg" alt="" /> They have characteristic
              club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in
              electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar
              corona, from which their name derives.

              <mark>note</mark> coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are
              many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus
              identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of
              respiratory illness, called COVID-19.

              The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals
              occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of
              domesticated chickens emerged in North America.Arthur Schalk and
              M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a
              new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The
              infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and
              listlessness with high mortality rates of 40-90%.Leland David
              Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused
              the infection in 1933.[17] The virus was then known as infectious
              bronchitis virus (IBV). Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert
              Beaudette cultivated the virus for the first time in 1937.[18] The
              specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain. In the late
              1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, JHM that causes brain
              disease (murine encephalitis) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that
              causes hepatitis in mice were discovered.[19] It was not realized
              at the time that these three different viruses were
              related.[20][12] Human coronaviruses were discovered in the
              1960s[21][22] using two different methods in the United Kingdom
              and the United States. E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David
              Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical
              Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated
              B814 in 1961. The virus could not be cultivated using standard
              techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses,
              adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell
              and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially
              passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea. The
              new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn.
              The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers
              caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had
              a lipid envelope. Dorothy Hamre and John Procknow at the
              University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students
              in 1962. They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue
              culture, designating it 229E. The novel virus caused a cold in
              volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether.[31]
              Transmission electron micrograph of organ cultured coronavirus
              OC43 Scottish virologist June Almeida at St Thomas' Hospital in
              London, collaborating with Tyrrell, compared the structures of
              IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967. Using electron microscopy the three
              viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general
              shape and distinctive club-like spikes. A research group at the
              National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate
              another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture
              and named one of the samples OC43 (OC for organ culture). Like
              B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive
              club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope. The
              IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also
              morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus. This new
              group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive
              morphological appearance. Human coronavirus 229E and human
              coronavirus OC43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades.The
              coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present
              human coronavirus it was. Other human coronaviruses have since
              been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003,
              HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.There
              have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified
              since the 1960s.
