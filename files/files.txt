CRIME
In ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority.
The term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition,
 though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes.
 The most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, 
 something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law.
  One proposed definition is that a crime or offence (or criminal offence) 
  is an act harmful not only to some individual but also to a community, society, 
or the state ("a public wrong"). Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law.

Etymology
The word crime is derived from the Latin root cernō, meaning 
"I decide, I give judgment". Originally the Latin word crīmen meant "charge" or "cry of distress".
The Ancient Greek word κρίμα, krima, from which the Latin cognate derives, 
typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, 
rather than a private or moral wrong.

Criminalization
ne can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, 
using the threat of punishment as a deterrent to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm.
 The state becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing
  (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it 
(restricting individual liberty, for example, to minimize harm to others)
